🌿 What is Veganism?

🐾 Why Go Vegan?
✅ For the Animals 🐮🐔🐷 – Every living being deserves compassion and respect. Going vegan helps prevent cruelty and suffering in factory farms and industries.

✅ For the Planet 🌎💚 – Animal agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, greenhouse gases, and water pollution. A plant-based diet reduces your environmental footprint.
